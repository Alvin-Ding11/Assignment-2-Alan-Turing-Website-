    <h2 class="headersv2"> History </h2> 
    <p class="paras"> Widly regarded as the father of computer science, Alan Turing was born <b>June 23, 1912</b> in London, England. He developed an interest as well as a strong understanding in mathematics and science at a young age, leading to him becoming top of his class at King's College (where he went for university). Shortly after his graduation, he was brought to Bletchley Park at the start of World War 2 to help with the war effort as a codebreaker, specifically to tackle the challenging Enigma cipher machine. The importance of his contributions in the eventual cracking of the device helped the Allies win the war, and his further contributions to the field of computer sciecne and artificial intelligence laid the path for the success we now see today in the two fields. He died in <b>1954</b> from cyanide poisoing (later confirmed as suicide) after being prosecuted for his homosexuality, a crime at the time in England. He was officialy pardoned by the Queen in 2014, one of only four since the ending of the Secound World War.</p>

    <h3 class="headersv2" style="text-align:right;"> Contribution's </h3>
    <p class="paras"> Turing's contributions to the field of Computer's started durings his years after graduation but before his work at Bletchley Park, when he came upon the idea of the Turing Machine. The principle (simplified) was that an indivudual Turing Machine that solved things one particular way, combined with multiple Turing machines could culminate into a universal Turing machine that could any well defined task. This theory is now known as a computer, a combination of programs that can solve any task defied well enough to fit under the task's it is capable of running. But not only did he make contributions to computer science, but he also breathed life into what artificial intelligence with the idea of the "Turing Test", testing whether a human would be able to distingush the difference in answer between a computer and a human. This philisophical disscusion is still at the root of many artificial intelligence debates to this day. </p>

    <h3 class="headersv2"> Intresting Facts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="list"> Turing was an incredible long distance runner, sometimes even running the 64km to London to meetings. He tried out for the 1948 Olympic team and would have likely made it if it were not for an injury. His time was only 11 minutes slower then the eventual silver medalist. </li>
      <li class="list">Among his many odd habits while working in Hut 8, Turing chained his mug to the radiator to prevent it from being stolen.</li>
      <li class="list">Working with an undergradute colleague, Turing wrote out a chess program that was used later on once computers caught up to his programing. Garry Kasparov said later that the "Turochamp" was able to <q>play a recognizable game of chess</q>.</li>
      <li class="list">A half eaten appele was found beside Turing's body when he died, and was likely the way that Turing had injested the cyanide. Theories suggest that he was re-enacting the scene from <i>Snow White</i> which was his favorite fairy tale.</li>
