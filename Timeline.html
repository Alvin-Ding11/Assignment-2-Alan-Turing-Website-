        <td> He  is enrolled into Sherborne School (a boarding school) after his teachers and parents start to take notice of his abilities. His preferance for the sciences and maths as opposed to the classics made him nupopular with the teachers during his time there.</td>

        <td>1936</td>
        <td> Turing published his paper on computation and his hypothetical devices that were reformulated from an arithmetic-based language conceived by Kurt Godel. Those devices would later be coined as "Turing Machines" and the paper would later be coined as the most influencial math paper in history.</td>

        <td>Starts his work at Bletchley Park, focusing primarily on a method of reliably decrypting the German Enigma machine. Through the use of probability and the creation of the "bombe" (device created specifically to decipher the Enigma machine), he was able to reliably decipher the Enigma machine for the Allies. </td>

        <td>1945</td>
        <td>After the war, he started working on the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) which was the first design for an electroniclly dependent computer rather than plugboards. These designs were later used to create some of the first stored-program computers in 1950. He also continue to dabble in computers as well as maths and pattern formations.</td>
